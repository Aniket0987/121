            "Description: Investors need to reconcile the logic of paying the same valuation for Infosys as compared to two years back when growth was significantly better\n",
            "Content: Caught in the slugfest between the bulls and the bears in the last two years from July 2022 to July 2024, the shares of Infosys have moved up and down umpteen times. In the process, shares have managed to eke out 18 per cent gain in this period (aided by the 7 per cent upmove in the last five trading days), yet widely underperforming the Nifty 50, which is up nearly 50 per cent in the same period. However, on one metric the stock is exactly where it was two years ago – trailing PE valuation. Mid-July 2022, Infosys traded at a PE of 27 times. Today, it trades exactly at the same level, at 27 times. The inference we can make from the stock’s underperformance in the last two years is that, investors overpaid then (bl.portfolio had warned of this in reviews of quarterly results). The inference we can make from stock’s valuation today is that investors are overpaying even more! Here’s why.\n",
            "\n",
            "Reconciling the valuation dichotomy\n",
            "\n",
            "Two years ago, when Infosys delivered Q1 FY23 results, the company reported year-on-year constant currency (CC) revenue growth of 21.4 per cent. Today, in its Q1 FY25 results, Infosys reported CC revenue growth of 2.5 per cent. Notice the enormous divide between growth two years ago and now? Yet company trades at the same trailing PE! Even when you consider valuation on a forward basis, Infosys forward PE in mid-July 2022 was 25 times, while it is 26.8 times today.\n",
            "\n",
            "What exactly is the logic of valuing a company at 7 per cent premium (26.8 upon 25), when business conditions are significantly weak compared with two years back?\n",
            "\n",
            "Sure, the Q1 FY25 results were better than expectations with revenue 2 per cent above consensus estimates, while EBIT was 3 per cent above. However, operating margins are flat at around 21 per cent compared with Q1 FY23 or with Q1 FY24. So not much progress on the margin front in recent years.\n",
            "\n",
            "Revenue (CC) guidance for FY25 was increased from 1-3 per cent to 3-4 per cent, which implies increase in mid-point from 2 to 3.5 per cent. However, it is important to note that the increase in guidance now, includes the positive impact from an acquisition (in-tech, a ER&D services company). Excluding this impact, the year-on-year growth in CC revenue guidance roughly works out to around 2-3 or 3.25 per cent. The mid-point at 2.5-2.62 per cent is not much of an uplift from the earlier 2 per cent.\n",
            "\n",
            "Considering these, while there might be a lot of buzz following Infosys results given the beat in revenue/earnings and increase in guidance, digging through the details, there is not much to get excited about. Management guidance apart, marginal reduction in headcount during the quarter (0.5 per cent), continuing weakness in North America (year-on-year CC revenue declined 1.2 per cent) imply a swift turnaround is unlikely. Further possibility of US recession, means investors must seek value before buying stocks like Infosys.\n",
            "\n",
            "At bl.portfolio, we had recommended investors to book profits in Infosys in June 2021, when the stock was trading at ₹1,385. Since then Infosys has underperformed the Nifty 50, with 27 per cent returns compared with Nifty 50’s 60 per cent returns. As mentioned above, currently investors need to reconcile the logic of paying the same 27 times valuation for a low-growth stock compared with 27 times two years ago for a high-growth stock. When this exercise is done, the inference will be clear that the shares of Infosys are not attractive, although it might be a high-quality company. Hence, we recommend that investors wait for cheaper valuations before considering the stock for investment. It would also be worth noting that in the earlier decade, when growth was this low, Infosys used to trade at a trailing PE of 15 times.\n",

            "Content: There is no doubt the top-tier Indian IT companies are not just the best managed companies in India, but amongst the best globally. Their past track record over the last two decades exemplifies this. So does their size and scale. With the exception of Accenture, it is the Indian companies that dominate the global IT services space. But does that provide a sufficient case for paying any price for their stocks when growth is disappointing?\n",
            "\n",
            "Thought experiment\n",
            "\n",
            "What happens when a company continues to reward employees without any improvement in their productivity? It will result in the profit margins of the company getting squeezed. Why? If the increase in salaries per employee is higher than the increase in revenue per employee, all other costs trending in line with revenue, will mean profit margins will have to reduce. If other costs are capped, profit margins may hold for a while, but not for long. This is what happened for the IT companies in FY22 and FY23, when revenue growth was good, but an increase in salaries and subcontracting costs resulted in decline in profit margins, and consequently profits growing slower than revenue.\n",
            "\n",
            "Investors need to apply this same logic to share price as well. What happens when lower growth is rewarded with higher valuation? May be, at best, stock returns can hold for a while (phase 1), but eventually it will underperform earnings growth (phase 2) and if earnings growth too is low (phase 3) , it can end up being a double whammy for investors in the long run.\n",
            "\n",
            "For IT stocks, phase 1 has played out well over the last one year as can be seen in the table below, wherein stocks have substantially outperformed earnings growth.\n",
            "\n",
            "It would be reasonable to make an argument that, if valuations were cheap, then stocks can outperform earnings growth for a while. But then here is some data on how the IT stocks are valued now when growth is weak, versus how they were valued when growth was booming. We have considered the constant currency revenue growth metric here, as operationally, it is one of the most important metrics that provide information on underlying business trends.\n",
            "\n",
            "And here is another set of data to consider. How the IT stocks were valued when growth was as weak as now in the previous decade.\n",
            "\n",
            "Looking at these charts, it is quite clear that the growth over the next few years has to be significantly high to justify current valuations. While investors are expressing confidence in this, fundamental data points and only cautiously optimistic management commentary do not support this investor euphoria.\n",
            "\n",
            "US GDP growth is witnessing a deceleration versus CY23 and recession risks remain for later part of this year or early next year. IT discretionary spending remains weak as per management commentary and can be evinced from recent quarterly results as well. AI impact on IT services companies remains uncertain. While the companies are gearing their investments towards building AI capabilities, how exactly it will disrupt business trends remains unclear.\n",
            "\n",
            "Even if one were to consider the optimistic scenario that the IT companies will capitalise on the trends as they have during phases of previous disruptions, here is another fact to consider. Much of the digital/cloud revolution in IT services happened during the 2014-24 decade. During this period, the widespread adoption by enterprises of digital and cloud services apart, there was also the Covid-driven accelerated digital spending. During this period, the revenue growth for the top IT services companies was as follows:\n",
            "\n",
            "In rupee terms, the growth in the previous decade can be considered quite decent. However, it needs to be noted that this came with the benefits of currency depreciation as can be seen from the difference in revenue growth in INR and USD terms. So two things need to be kept in mind here. While AI theme can benefit IT services companies, it may be challenging to repeat the growth of previous decade, given their larger size today. Growth tapers as size increases. Further, whether currency benefits of the previous decade will play out this decade too needs to be contemplated upon.\n",
            "\n",
            "After the recent upside in IT stocks, the question that arises is: Is the worst over given the stocks’/ Nifty IT underperformance from their prior peak in December-January 2022? Looking at the data above, given current valuations and fundamentals, investors may have to endure a more prolonged phase of sub-par returns.\n",

            "In Q1FY25, revenue stood at ₹39,315 crore, an increase from Q4FY24’s revenue of ₹37,923 crore. In the same quarter last fiscal, the company’s revenue was ₹37,933 crore, a growth of 2.5 per cent YoY in CC terms.\n",

            "One-time interest\n",
            "\n",
            "The net profit for the quarter stood at ₹6,368 crore, a decline of 20.1 per cent from Q4’s ₹7,969 crore. The decline in net profit was due to a one-time interest on an income tax refund included in ‘Other income’ in the fourth quarter of the previous financial year, amounting to ₹1,916 crore. However, profit after tax (PAT) rose by 7.1 per cent from ₹5,945 crore in Q1 of the last fiscal.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Strong deal pipeline, improvement in key markets, and recent acquisition are building the confidence for us to up the guidance. Our performance in Q1 was strong on volumes, and financial services in the US are seeing early signs of improvement. Strong performance on the large deals front in the first quarter gives more visibility into this financial year; the in-tech acquisition also helps us in this guidance,” said Salil Parekh, CEO and MD of Infosys. “With our focused approach for generative AI for enterprises working with their data sets on a cloud foundation, we have strong traction with our clients. This is building on our Topaz and Cobalt capabilities.”\n",
            "\n",
            "The company claimed that the number of large deal wins this quarter was its highest ever at 34 with the total contract value (TCV) being $4.1 billion. However, TCV for the last quarter stood at $4.5 billion.\n",
            "\n",
            "Operating margins for the quarter stood at 21.1 percent, with a growth of 0.3 percent yoy and 1 percent q-o-q. Operating margin guidance, even for FY25, has been retained at 20-22 percent.\n",
            "\n",
            "Jayesh Sanghrajka, CFO, said, “We had 80 bps coming from project Maximus - a margin expansion program, on the back of better pricing, value-based selling, and better benefits from efficiency. 40 bps was from a one-off benefit from one of the clients.”\n",

            "Infosys’ total headcount fell by 1,908 employees to 3,15,332, from 3,17,240 last quarter. In the first quarter of FY24, the headcount was 3,36,294, a reduction of 20,962 employees since. Voluntary attrition during the quarter rose to 12.7 per cent from 12.6 per cent in Q4. “Our utilisation is already at 85 per cent, and we have a little headroom left, so as we start seeing growth, we will look at hiring. We are looking at hiring 15,000-20,000 freshers this year depending on the growth,” the CFO said.\n",
            "\n",
            "About 58.9 per cent of Infosys’ revenue came from North America, with a contribution of 3.1 per cent from India, an increase from last quarter’s 2.2 per cent. As far as verticals are concerned, Infosys has shown growth in the BFSI sector. The retail and communication sectors follow behind in terms of revenue share.\n",
            "\n",
            "Biswajit Maity, senior principal analyst at Gartner, said, “Despite various microeconomic challenges and discretionary spending from clients, Infosys’s overall outlook remains positive as its deal pipeline remains good. A 3.6 per cent increase QoQ is a strong indicator of its performance. We’ve consistently highlighted that this year will bring growth. IT service buyers will be cautious with spending and focus on strong business outcomes. Organisations will carefully approach new projects in the first half of 2024, expecting a better environment later.” He added that over the past few years, Infosys has successfully attracted an increasing number of large deals through an effective large-deal pursuit strategy. Significant deal wins in FY24 are expected to drive revenue growth in FY25.\n",
            "\n",
            "Commenting about the results, Shaji Nair, Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas said, “Infosys 3.6 per cent quarter-on-quarter revenue growth in constant currency, surpassing estimates led by broad-based growth across verticals, while the EBIT margin expanded by 100 basis points aided by Project Maximus, also beating expectations. Notably, the company is experiencing early signs of improvement in financial services in the US which augurs well for the stock. The strong Q1 numbers and upward guidance revision is likely to lead to an upward revision in earnings estimates.”\n",

            "Content: Caught in the slugfest between the bulls and the bears in the last two years from July 2022 to July 2024, the shares of Infosys have moved up and down umpteen times. In the process, shares have managed to eke out 18 per cent gain in this period (aided by the 7 per cent upmove in the last five trading days), yet widely underperforming the Nifty 50, which is up nearly 50 per cent in the same period. However, on one metric the stock is exactly where it was two years ago – trailing PE valuation. Mid-July 2022, Infosys traded at a PE of 27 times. Today, it trades exactly at the same level, at 27 times. The inference we can make from the stock’s underperformance in the last two years is that, investors overpaid then (bl.portfolio had warned of this in reviews of quarterly results). The inference we can make from stock’s valuation today is that investors are overpaying even more! Here’s why.\n",
            "\n",
            "Reconciling the valuation dichotomy\n",
            "\n",
            "Two years ago, when Infosys delivered Q1 FY23 results, the company reported year-on-year constant currency (CC) revenue growth of 21.4 per cent. Today, in its Q1 FY25 results, Infosys reported CC revenue growth of 2.5 per cent. Notice the enormous divide between growth two years ago and now? Yet company trades at the same trailing PE! Even when you consider valuation on a forward basis, Infosys forward PE in mid-July 2022 was 25 times, while it is 26.8 times today.\n",
            "\n",
            "What exactly is the logic of valuing a company at 7 per cent premium (26.8 upon 25), when business conditions are significantly weak compared with two years back?\n",
            "\n",
            "Sure, the Q1 FY25 results were better than expectations with revenue 2 per cent above consensus estimates, while EBIT was 3 per cent above. However, operating margins are flat at around 21 per cent compared with Q1 FY23 or with Q1 FY24. So not much progress on the margin front in recent years.\n",
            "\n",
            "Revenue (CC) guidance for FY25 was increased from 1-3 per cent to 3-4 per cent, which implies increase in mid-point from 2 to 3.5 per cent. However, it is important to note that the increase in guidance now, includes the positive impact from an acquisition (in-tech, a ER&D services company). Excluding this impact, the year-on-year growth in CC revenue guidance roughly works out to around 2-3 or 3.25 per cent. The mid-point at 2.5-2.62 per cent is not much of an uplift from the earlier 2 per cent.\n",
            "\n",
            "Considering these, while there might be a lot of buzz following Infosys results given the beat in revenue/earnings and increase in guidance, digging through the details, there is not much to get excited about. Management guidance apart, marginal reduction in headcount during the quarter (0.5 per cent), continuing weakness in North America (year-on-year CC revenue declined 1.2 per cent) imply a swift turnaround is unlikely. Further possibility of US recession, means investors must seek value before buying stocks like Infosys.\n",
            "\n",
            "At bl.portfolio, we had recommended investors to book profits in Infosys in June 2021, when the stock was trading at ₹1,385. Since then Infosys has underperformed the Nifty 50, with 27 per cent returns compared with Nifty 50’s 60 per cent returns. As mentioned above, currently investors need to reconcile the logic of paying the same 27 times valuation for a low-growth stock compared with 27 times two years ago for a high-growth stock. When this exercise is done, the inference will be clear that the shares of Infosys are not attractive, although it might be a high-quality company. Hence, we recommend that investors wait for cheaper valuations before considering the stock for investment. It would also be worth noting that in the earlier decade, when growth was this low, Infosys used to trade at a trailing PE of 15 times.\n",

            "Content: There is no doubt the top-tier Indian IT companies are not just the best managed companies in India, but amongst the best globally. Their past track record over the last two decades exemplifies this. So does their size and scale. With the exception of Accenture, it is the Indian companies that dominate the global IT services space. But does that provide a sufficient case for paying any price for their stocks when growth is disappointing?\n",
            "\n",
            "Thought experiment\n",
            "\n",
            "What happens when a company continues to reward employees without any improvement in their productivity? It will result in the profit margins of the company getting squeezed. Why? If the increase in salaries per employee is higher than the increase in revenue per employee, all other costs trending in line with revenue, will mean profit margins will have to reduce. If other costs are capped, profit margins may hold for a while, but not for long. This is what happened for the IT companies in FY22 and FY23, when revenue growth was good, but an increase in salaries and subcontracting costs resulted in decline in profit margins, and consequently profits growing slower than revenue.\n",
            "\n",
            "Investors need to apply this same logic to share price as well. What happens when lower growth is rewarded with higher valuation? May be, at best, stock returns can hold for a while (phase 1), but eventually it will underperform earnings growth (phase 2) and if earnings growth too is low (phase 3) , it can end up being a double whammy for investors in the long run.\n",
            "\n",
            "For IT stocks, phase 1 has played out well over the last one year as can be seen in the table below, wherein stocks have substantially outperformed earnings growth.\n",
            "\n",
            "It would be reasonable to make an argument that, if valuations were cheap, then stocks can outperform earnings growth for a while. But then here is some data on how the IT stocks are valued now when growth is weak, versus how they were valued when growth was booming. We have considered the constant currency revenue growth metric here, as operationally, it is one of the most important metrics that provide information on underlying business trends.\n",
            "\n",
            "And here is another set of data to consider. How the IT stocks were valued when growth was as weak as now in the previous decade.\n",
            "\n",
            "Looking at these charts, it is quite clear that the growth over the next few years has to be significantly high to justify current valuations. While investors are expressing confidence in this, fundamental data points and only cautiously optimistic management commentary do not support this investor euphoria.\n",
            "\n",
            "US GDP growth is witnessing a deceleration versus CY23 and recession risks remain for later part of this year or early next year. IT discretionary spending remains weak as per management commentary and can be evinced from recent quarterly results as well. AI impact on IT services companies remains uncertain. While the companies are gearing their investments towards building AI capabilities, how exactly it will disrupt business trends remains unclear.\n",
            "\n",
            "Even if one were to consider the optimistic scenario that the IT companies will capitalise on the trends as they have during phases of previous disruptions, here is another fact to consider. Much of the digital/cloud revolution in IT services happened during the 2014-24 decade. During this period, the widespread adoption by enterprises of digital and cloud services apart, there was also the Covid-driven accelerated digital spending. During this period, the revenue growth for the top IT services companies was as follows:\n",
            "\n",
            "In rupee terms, the growth in the previous decade can be considered quite decent. However, it needs to be noted that this came with the benefits of currency depreciation as can be seen from the difference in revenue growth in INR and USD terms. So two things need to be kept in mind here. While AI theme can benefit IT services companies, it may be challenging to repeat the growth of previous decade, given their larger size today. Growth tapers as size increases. Further, whether currency benefits of the previous decade will play out this decade too needs to be contemplated upon.\n",
            "\n",
            "After the recent upside in IT stocks, the question that arises is: Is the worst over given the stocks’/ Nifty IT underperformance from their prior peak in December-January 2022? Looking at the data above, given current valuations and fundamentals, investors may have to endure a more prolonged phase of sub-par returns.\n",

The decline in net profit was due to a one-time interest on an income tax refund included in ‘Other income’ in the fourth quarter of the previous financial year, amounting to ₹1,916 crore. However, profit after tax (PAT) rose by 7.1 per cent from ₹5,945 crore in Q1 of the last fiscal.\n",

            "“Strong deal pipeline, improvement in key markets, and recent acquisition are building the confidence for us to up the guidance. Our performance in Q1 was strong on volumes, and financial services in the US are seeing early signs of improvement. Strong performance on the large deals front in the first quarter gives more visibility into this financial year; the in-tech acquisition also helps us in this guidance,” said Salil Parekh, CEO and MD of Infosys. “With our focused approach for generative AI for enterprises working with their data sets on a cloud foundation, we have strong traction with our clients. This is building on our Topaz and Cobalt capabilities.”\n",

Voluntary attrition during the quarter rose to 12.7 per cent from 12.6 per cent in Q4. “Our utilisation is already at 85 per cent, and we have a little headroom left, so as we start seeing growth, we will look at hiring. We are looking at hiring 15,000-20,000 freshers this year depending on the growth,” the CFO said.\n",

            "About 58.9 per cent of Infosys’ revenue came from North America, with a contribution of 3.1 per cent from India, an increase from last quarter’s 2.2 per cent.

            "Biswajit Maity, senior principal analyst at Gartner, said, “Despite various microeconomic challenges and discretionary spending from clients, Infosys’s overall outlook remains positive as its deal pipeline remains good. A 3.6 per cent increase QoQ is a strong indicator of its performance. We’ve consistently highlighted that this year will bring growth. IT service buyers will be cautious with spending and focus on strong business outcomes. Organisations will carefully approach new projects in the first half of 2024, expecting a better environment later.” He added that over the past few years, Infosys has successfully attracted an increasing number of large deals through an effective large-deal pursuit strategy.

Notably, the company is experiencing early signs of improvement in financial services in the US which augurs well for the stock.

            "Content: On Friday, Morgan Stanley maintained its Overweight rating on Infosys (NS: ) Ltd. (INFO:IN) (NYSE: INFY) stock and increased its price target to INR2,050.00, up from the previous INR1,650.00. The firm's optimism is based on revised revenue growth forecasts and margin assumptions for the upcoming fiscal years.\n",
            "\n",
            "The analyst at Morgan Stanley projects a year-over-year revenue growth increase of 5.3% for fiscal year 2025 and 8.7% for fiscal year 2026. These projections have led to a 1.5%-2.5% upward revision in the revenue estimates for fiscal years 2025 to 2027, expressed in USD. Additionally, slight adjustments have been made to the EBIT margin assumptions for the same period, with an increase of 10-30 basis points.\n",
            "\n",
            "These revised margins and growth expectations have resulted in higher net income estimates, which are now 2%-6% greater than previous calculations. The valuation model used by Morgan Stanley has also been updated, with the valuation now rolled forward by six months to September 2026.\n",
            "\n",
            "Morgan Stanley has adjusted the probabilities of different scenarios in its analysis, increasing the likelihood of a bull case to 30% from the prior 20%, while decreasing the bear case probability to 10% from 20%. The new price target of INR2,050.00 is based on approximately 27 times the estimated earnings per share (EPS) for September 2026.\n",
            "\n",
            "The firm suggests that Infosys could potentially outperform Tata Consultancy Services (NS: ) in terms of revenue growth during an upcycle, which may lead to a narrowing of the valuation multiple gap between the two companies.\n",
